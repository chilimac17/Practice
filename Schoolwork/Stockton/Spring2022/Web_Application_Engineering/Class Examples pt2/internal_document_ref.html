        <h1> About Stockton</h1>
        <p>
            Stockton University is a public university in Galloway Township, New Jersey. It is part
             of New Jersey's public system of higher education. It is named for Richard Stockton, 
             one of the New Jersey signers of the Declaration of Independence. Founded in 1969, 
             Stockton accepted its charter class in 1971. At its opening in 1971, classes were held 
             at the Mayflower Hotel in Atlantic City; the campus in Galloway Township began 
             operating late in 1971. Nearly 10,000 students are enrolled at Stockton 
            and it is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

            In November 1968, New Jersey approved a $202.5 million (equivalent to $1507.03 million 
            in 2020) capital construction bond issue with an earmarked $15 million (equivalent to 
            $111.63 million in 2020) designated for the construction of a new state college in 
            Southern New Jersey. In 1969, a 1,600-acre (650-hectare) tract was selected for the 
            campus in the heart of the Pine Barrens in Galloway Township. The trustees originally 
            named the school "South Jersey State College", but they later renamed it to "Stockton 
            State College", in order to avoid confusion with Rutgers College of South Jersey.
