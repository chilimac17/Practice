           George Washington (February 22, 1732[b] â€“ December 14, 1799) was an American 
           soldier, statesman, and Founding Father who served as the first president of the United States 
           from 1789 to 1797. Appointed by the Continental Congress as commander of the Continental Army, 
           Washington led the Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War, and presided at the 
           Constitutional Convention of 1787, which established the Constitution of the United States and a 
           federal government. Washington has been called the "Father of the Nation"[10] for his manifold 
           leadership in the formative days of the country.

        <p align = "justify" > Washington played an indispensable role in adopting and ratifying the 
            Constitution of the United States. He was then twice elected president by the Electoral College 
            unanimously. As president, he implemented a strong, well-financed national government while 
            remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry between cabinet members Thomas Jefferson and Alexander 
            Hamilton. <b><i>During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while 
                sanctioning the Jay Treaty. He set enduring precedents for the office of president, 
                including the title "Mr. President", and his Farewell Address is widely regarded as a 
                pre-eminent statement on republicanism.</i></b>
